# Boost

An open-source motivational bot for Messenger.

Since it is built on the [Botpress](https://github.com/botpress/botpress) platform, it is simple, lightweight (~250 lines of code) and portable.

## Features

- Three different categories of videos (**work**, **life** and **gym**)
- Fetch videos metadata from YouTube
- Subscription to send daily videos at 8AM (users timezone)

## Roadmap

- Personalize the send time (currently only 8AM)
- Don't send the same user the same videos

## Requirements

Botpress requires [node](https://nodejs.org) (version >= 4.2) and uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) as package manager.

Boost is powered by [Botpress](https://github.com/botpress/botpress), an open-source bot platform.

## Getting started

You should get familiar with [Botpress](https://github.com/botpress/botpress) and the main modules this bot uses (botpress-messenger, botpress-broadcast, botpress-scheduler, botpress-subscriptions).

### Running the bot

Install the bot:

```
npm install
```

Run it:

```
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY> npm start
```

The bot should be running at `http://localhost:3000`

To develop and test locally, we suggest you setup [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) in the botpress-messenger module.

You must re-run (`npm start`) after every change to the bot code.
